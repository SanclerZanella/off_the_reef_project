                                <p>Choosing the right surfboard is one of the most, if not the most important purchasing
                                    decision you’ll
                                    make when it comes to an enjoyable wave ride. <br><br>

                                    Whether you’re a complete beginner learning to surf, beginner intermediate or ready
                                    to break
                                    out in
                                    the pro scene. Understanding the fundamentals behind board design, sizing, shape is
                                    important. The
                                    engineering that goes behind board design is invaluable information. You’ll never
                                    truly know
                                    what a
                                    board suited for you really feels like. <br>
                                    Choosing the right board comes down to your surfing skill, surf conditions, types of
                                    waves,
                                    and
                                    believe it or not, your fitness level. <br><br></p>

                                <p>It all comes into play when buying a board, not to mention paraphernalia like

                                    surfboard fins, leg ropes, and traction pads.
                                    If you have ever walked into a surf shop, or browsed online, you’ll know that
                                    there
                                    is more

                                    couple to choose from. It seems like a new brand is coming out weekly with their
                                    claims
                                    they’re
                                    calling “breakthrough” designs. <br><br>

                                    The history of surfing has come a long way over the past 240 years, back when
                                    they
                                    used
                                    carved
                                    timber trees. Surfboard models are still designed by a surfboard shaper, but a
                                    select few
                                    companies
                                    have taken that leap of faith in technology. <br><br>

                                    Software like Autodesk can simulate water flow, buoyancy, gravity, braking
                                    force,
                                    and
                                    rigidity. As
                                    well as various other simulations allowing designers to determine how a board
                                    will
                                    perform.
                                    Adding
                                    gravity allows designers to add a human-like weight to the board. This allows
                                    simulating
                                    wave, and
                                    surfing conditions providing accurate reporting.
                                    Autodesk isn’t the only company pushing accurate computer simulations either,
                                    companies like
                                    Siemens
                                    have made PLM software for making firewire surfboards. <br><br>

                                    This technology has been used for years on projects developed by world-leading
                                    governments.
                                    The
                                    Defense force uses computer simulations to determine outcomes for real-world
                                    situations.
                                    It’s now
                                    being used to shape the future of the surfing industry. <br><br>

                                    This advancement in design makes your job as a consumer buying a board, a
                                    stressful,
                                    and
                                    frustrating
                                    experience, easier. there are tens of thousands of different types of surfboards
                                    to
                                    choose
                                    from.
                                    Your local surf shop to put it simply doesn’t have that many in stock. <br><br>

                                    Look at the facts, a retailer needs to sell products to stay in business, they
                                    cannot sell a
                                    product
                                    they don’t stock, and cannot get. They’re going to sell you something they have
                                    in
                                    stock,
                                    whether
                                    it’s appropriate for you or not, and worst of all. Not to mention sold something
                                    not
                                    appropriate
                                    that has a higher profit margin. <br><br>
